The importance of a comfortable development environment for learning CSS and JavaScript cannot be overstated. In my experience, having the right tools can significantly boost your learning and productivity. For example, I have been using VS Code as my editor for the past year and have found it to be an invaluable tool for writing both R and web development code.

One of the key advantages of using VS Code for web development is its ability to preview HTML files. However, when it comes to debugging scripts and testing ideas, the Chrome browser is even more important. This is because DOM-related features are only available in the browser environment, allowing you to view HTML element variables in the browserâ€™s console.

In my own learning journey, I have found that practicing DOM manipulation with the `ul` element is particularly helpful. By inserting `li` elements into a `ul` element at arbitrary positions or before and after the `ul` element, you can gain a better understanding of how JavaScript can be used to change the rendering of HTML.
