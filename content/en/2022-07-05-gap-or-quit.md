For whatever reason, I decided at this time to take a year off from my master's program to look for an internship. My parents objected strongly, as I had anticipated, believing that I had put a lot of effort into getting this master's degree and would no longer pursue graduate studies. They also reaffirmed the importance of a master's degree for my future professional success. In fact, I earned this master's degree almost effortlessly, and if I retake the master's entrance exam, I'm confident I can enroll in a better university. What they said is true that a master's degree is indeed significant for some jobs. However, I don't feel any progress in my first year of studies. I felt that not only what I was doing but what most of the teachers in our department were doing was nonsenseâ€”it was a waste of money, time, and energy. Additionally, I want to sharpen my math and programming abilities, but my tutor either won't give me any instruction or, worse yet, occasionally gives me instructions that are blatantly incorrect.

I'm not so confident and also bewildered. What can I do if I quit my master's studies? I don't know. However, I have to make a decision and am unwilling to escape reality again.
