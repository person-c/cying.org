IÂ have lost her permanently; she refused to meet with me.

The five-year relationship has come to an end.

Tianjin's breeze is at ease. However, I am unable to accompany her across the river in the soft breeze because she already has a companion. The environment in her university is suitable for walking for lovers. However, I cannot meet her; what I can do is pace in her university alone, not stopping to imagine her and her companion walking hand in hand and smiling at each other. This is a path she has ever come across, with her boyfriend. I could also pace along the path, with my shadow.

I had imagined walking with her hand in hand across the river in pure air; I had imagined hugging her in my arms. I had imagined lying with her on the lawn to admire the starry sky. All these are fancy. She had her companion. I had considered her in all my plans, but they were all finished...

Should I  start my own life? Her leave brings not only herself but also my belief in love; Maybe I'm wrong;
