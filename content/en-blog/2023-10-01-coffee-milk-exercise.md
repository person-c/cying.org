Too many pushes on internet so I heared of the dark coffee's functionality of aggregating your metablization and fat metabolism. Given that I need to run to reduce my fat, I buy some so-called dark coffee to test.

Instant coffee powder is cheap and easy for me to brew. You can brew coffee with hot or cool water and milk, or something else. A bitter taste filled my taste buds when I took a sip of coffee. However, that doesn't affect my insterst in coffee because I may subconsiouly assume that the bitter flavor brings goodness to me. But I actually felt nothing good about coffee except for the sleepy. I don't feel the refreshing effect of coffee but still continue to take a cup of coffee every day.

I get the chance to brew coffee with cool milk when I returned home. Just a coincidence, I suddenly wanted to drink coffee with cool milk and find the mellow flavor. In fact, I fount that it's just a kind of coffee called Latte. I love this favour, and the dark roast coffee is compatible with the cool milk best I found.

No matter what I initially wanted to take some coffee to help me to improve my exercise performance; In the previous mothes, I didn't feel any improvement the coffee brought to me. But when I began to run, I can run 10 kilometers what's impossible for me in the past. I didn't have 8-pack abs.

Coffee maybe indeed a good thing, no matter for favour —— of course, it's the favour of coffee with milk or exercise performance improvement.
