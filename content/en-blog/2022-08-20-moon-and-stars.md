When I was a youngster, about ten years old, living in the countryside, I'd like to lie on the chair in the yard to watch the white moon and twinkling stars, wondering whether there were sages or immortals with manas.  The summer evening breeze blew on my face, bringing a little cool, and various animals I could not identify made noise at night. It was a kind of feeling of calm and ease, but for now, I would never come back to have the chance to watch the night sky for both a busy life and faded stars because of more shiny neons. Have the stars vanished? No, they are just veined with something lighter.

#### Faded stars

Actually Not only disappeared the stars but also something vanished for being veined by some more eye-focused things.

When I was in high school, the first time I learned Darwin's theories of evolution, I was astonished by his intelligence that he could see the vanished things—the vanished animals. That is not the laws of use and disuse, but just animals that have not adjusted to the environment have permanently died. If I were a biologist at that time, I definitely would have concluded laws of use and disuse. After that, I frequently remind myself that something else must be hiding beneath my view, aside from some things I can watch out for.

The internet and all forms of media share the same trait in that they consistently cover a hot topic at a given time, causing people to pay attention to that topic. Conflicting opinions frequently result in violent quarries at the same time. I'm unsure if it was intentional behavior or just an attempt to eye focus. Nevertheless, I believe that we should constantly remind ourselves that there may be something tinged by something too light. Every time I look at the people around me in cities, it seems like everyone is active and using the internet to enjoy life, but when I returned to the country, everyone was older and appeared to be working long hours. On the internet, I could only find very little information about their way of life, and some of the information about the countryside was made up for entertainment because people didn't care whether it was true . The more light, the more darkness.

#### Eternal moonlight

The moonlight was permanently mild and soft, never far away from me, which got me hooked on it and led me to assume it was preferable to me. However, it was not true—it fairly shins on everyone without preference, no matter who you are, handsome or ugly, wealthy or poor.

I have met many people in my 23 years of life, and some of them brought warmth to my depression period. With their companion, I talked with them and played games with them. Once I remembered those affairs, it was a comfort to me. However, any of them leaves after a short time of companionship. Then, going through many times-broken affairs, I suddenly realized that they were not in companionship with me but were looking for someone to waste time with, just in case to make acquaintance with me, and not only with me. Just like the moonlight, it was not a preference, but only a coincidence, a non-preference coincidence.
