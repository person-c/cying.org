## What should I care about?

Another year has passed, and some issues have arisen. What should I care about, and what is crucial for me? I don't know. Just write down some prominent topics to discuss.

## Should I care for my relationship?

By the end of 2022, I will be 24 years old, yet I have never begun a relationship with a woman. Must this bother me? This issue is a result of several circumstances. The main aspect, in my opinion, is my personality. I have a hard time getting motivated to talk to anyone, even my parents, relatives, and classmates. Sometimes, I feel lonely, but it's not a passive choice; it's my active choice to keep my distance from other people. To maintain harmony with others, you must put up with certain drawbacks; you must pamper others while also taking pleasure in some benefits, such as emotions of resonance, company when lonely, or studying and exercising together, as well as support. However, I don't trust people, or more specifically, I am not prepared to divulge anything about myself to anyone. Although someone else may have had a similar experience to you, I don't feel a genuine resonance in the world. You must deal with this issue on your own; sharing your experience won't assist you. It's cheaper and more effective to divulge your story online rather than with a friend if you can't stand withholding it from others. Many individuals online would be interested in hearing about your traumas out of curiosity. I once met a girl with whom I am prepared to share all of my possessions. She does nevertheless go. I ponder if the person I want to marry is the one I am ready to share everything with—my pleasures and sorrows—and exclusively share them with her without any subterfuge.

An online acquaintance of mine told me about her experience today. When I initially met her, she seemed kind and straightforward, with a soft voice and an innocent enthusiasm. She did, though, continue to be romantically involved with her classmate for almost three years up until the last month's break. She can't help but think back on the pleasant memories she had with her boyfriend, so she flies to his city solely to see him again. Presumably, her boyfriend declined to meet her as a result. Why did I convey this story? This type of scenario has been repeated to me several times. The majority of ladies still adore their formers, and some even continue to have sex with them—another tale I heard from another girl's account—simply because she perceives benefits from their harmonious sex and his attractive, muscular figure. My faith in women who have previously been in a relationship with another man is utterly obliterated by such things. They have tasted and experienced all kinds of play. Those thrills left a lasting impression. I genuinely believe that when a woman begins a relationship with a guy, she does so because she really loves him; thus, it seems doubtful that a woman who has previously been in a romantic partnership would come to experience the same emotions about another man. It's also unfortunate news if she really enters a relationship without experiencing any affection.

Maybe he loved you in the winter of 2021, but that was already the winter of 2022. Will this love be doomed to failure? Perhaps it will. However, you will always remember all of your occurrences, pleasant or sad. It will spontaneously emerge for a specified group of people at a particular location and time.

## Shoud I care for my career?

I've been out of school for half a year for a gap. What shall I do going forward? I chose to gap for the following reasons: In my graduate studies, I felt that my mentor offered me mostly mistaken advice—which, in my opinion, was even common knowledge in our field—rather than much helpful counsel. However, the roles of the student and tutor suppressed my impulse to contradict her. I can only respond with a yes or by remaining silent. Missed academic guidance makes it hard to complete a paper with complete logic and use to society—a little use is actually enough. It is intolerable to me to produce shite like paper—it's a waste of time and funding.However, when I began my internship, I unexpectedly discovered that the company's leader also resembles my tutor. Sometimes they will deliver poor solutions to your issues and are just interested in the outcome, regardless of how reasonable or logical the process was. They can simply ask you to complete a task using well-liked techniques or cutting-edge tools for producing papers quickly without considering the logic or propriety of those techniques. Like my tutor, you should be goal-oriented. Just do it and get the best possible, correct, and form-fitting result to submit. However, they can't understand the details.

Simply put, COVID-19's long-term school closure policy is the secondary reason. Other schools in Chongqing, however, either don't have a policy like this one or merely implement temporary confinement, similar to my university. Except with permission from the director or a clinical professional student for their employment in the hospital, students cannot be allowed to leave school for approximately one year. Indeed, the air leaving the school is clean and pleasant to breathe. It's a smell of freedom.
