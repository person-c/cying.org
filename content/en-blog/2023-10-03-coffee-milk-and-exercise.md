I heard of the dark coffee's functionality in aggregating fat metabolism due to numerous posts on the internet. Since I need to run to reduce fat, I decided to buy some dark coffee to test.

Instant coffee powder is cheap and easy for me to brew. You can brew coffee with hot or cool water and milk, or something else. As soon asI took a sip, the bitter taste filled my taste buds.  However, that doesn't affect my interest in coffee because I may subconsciously assume that the bitter flavor is beneficial. But I actually felt nothing good about coffee except for the sleepy. I don't feel the refreshing effect of coffee but still continue to take a cup of coffee every day.

I get the chance to brew coffee with cool milk when I returned home. Just a coincidence, I suddenly wanted to drink coffee with cool milk and find the mellow flavor. In fact, I found that it's just a kind of coffee called Latte. I love this favour, and the dark roast coffe goes well with coll milk, as I discovered.

No matter what,  I initially wanted to have some coffee to help me to improve my exercise performance; In the previous months, I didn't feel any improvement from the coffee. But when I began to run, I can run 10 kilometers which was impossible for me in the past. Despite this,  I didn't miraculously develop 8-pack abs.

Coffee may indeed be  a good thing, no matter for favour —— of course, it's the flavor of coffee with milk or improvement in exercise performance.
