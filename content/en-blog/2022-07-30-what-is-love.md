## Two stories(1)

 A girl asked for help translating a dialogue a few days ago in a post she made on social media. Given how effective the translation is now, I contacted her since I'm very interested in what the dialogue says. Then she provided me with a screenshot of a simple exchange of accusations between a man and a woman following a breakup, which made me wonder whether she was able to use translators. Even though she and the man may have some relationship, there appears to be a huge gap between them. Later, she revealed that the man in the conversation was her boyfriend, who is currently studying in England, and that the Turkish woman in question was in her 30s. Her partner had only flown to Turkey a month earlier to live with the Turkish woman after falling in love with her. He shared moments of living with the woman without protecting her. He then declared that he still adored her and would marry her. Simply put, she feels strongly depressed and uncertain.

Just a few days ago, I made an online acquaintance. She's only in her twenties. Prior to her sudden disclosure of her divorce, which astonished me given her young age of under 30 years old, I had always assumed she was unmarried. Even more astounding is the fact that she and her spouse have never engaged in sexual activity together. They supposedly fall in love during their university years, yet even then, they scarcely ever hug or kiss, according to her narrative. Is this platonic love? I'm unsure. And she decided to divorce herself, not for sex either.
