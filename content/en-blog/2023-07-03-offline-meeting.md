Yesterday, I met a lady whom I had met online for the first time offline, marking the first intimate relationship I've had with a woman in 24 years.  How can I begin to describe this experience? There are so many things I want to express and emotions I want to convey.

In my previous blog, I mentioned having a beloved girl for nearly 5 years, but I lost her forever just 2 months ago when she revealed she already had a boyfriend. It was likely a disengagement. I suddenly realized that I no longer loved her as I once did upon hearing this information. I question whether my love was merely an excuse or an idealized illusion. Why do I feel so at ease...

I met this lady on a social application. She is about 3 years older than me and has expressed her charming characteristics to me. Just two days ago, she informed me that she had come to the city where I live for work and would be staying for a few days, suggesting we meet if I returned home.  I believe it's an opportunity to restart my life-I have missed out on numerous opportunities to do this with the girl I love in the past, so I made the decision to meet her in person. I believe it's an opportunity to restart my life. I went to meet her on the second day and booked a hotel. As I said, it's my first time doing such things so I didn't have much knowledge or experience in such matters... I booked a budget hotel and made no preparations for entertainment activities before going to the hotel; I appreciate her understanding - She suggested a nice hotel and invited me to watch movies.

In fact, I didn't know what she looked like until I met her yesterday. When I see her at first glance,  I realized that she was taller than I had initially expected and had a nice figure.  Feeling the need to initiate a change, I took her hand during our movie time, marking the first time I held hands with a lady in 24 years. It's a sensation of trust and companionship. It felt incredibly natural in the hotel... It was a lovely experience to have a female companion when falling asleep...
