In the terrible winter of 1932-33, bridges of Communist Party activists went house to house in the countryside , looking for food. The brigade were from Moscow, Kyiv, and Karkiv, as well as villages down the road. They dug up gardens, broken open walls, and used long rods to poke up chimneys to find grain. They watched for smoke from chimneys, because that might means a family had hidden flour and was baking bread. They led away farm animals and confiscated tomato seedlings. After they left, Ukarainian peasants, deprived of food, ate rats, frogs and boil grass. They gnawed tree bark and leather. Many resorted to cannibalism to stay alive. Some 4 million died of starvation.
